					<p>Mechanical Characteristics for power tower climbing robot on a tower reliably, a double V-groove and a variable length. So that it was possible to clamp angle bars with various specifications in different directions. The CAD and mathematical model of the clamping mechanism were put forward and the clamping force was simulated</p>
